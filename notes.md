Core Issue

Archaeology is facing a replication crisis, similar to psychology and biomedical sciences.


  Concepts

Replication crisis is when likw scientific findings that cannot be reproduced
threatens trust in research (not sure what this means)???????

Open science--- sharing data, methods, code, and materials so others can verify or extend findings.

Digital archaeology---- use of 3D scans, modeling, LiDAR, databases, and digital archives.

Reproducibility --- ability to get the same result using the same data and methods.

Replicability — ability to confirm a finding using new data but similar procedures.

Transparency — clear documentation of how you collected/analyzed your data.

Metadata — data about data (e.g. how an artifact was measured, photographed, dated).

FAIR principles — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (a standard for open data).

Interoperability — data formats that can work across systems, people, and software.

Long-term archiving — preserving digital files so they don’t degrade or become obsolete.

Why Archaeology Is Vulnerable(or in a way......(

 you can’t re-excavate the same object once it’s removed.

 you lose the original context.

The record is fragmentary, often damaged, incomplete, or biased by preservation.


Data is scattered across:

museums

private collections

unpublished field notes



Harder to detect errors, bias, or misinterpretations.

Missing data means whole histories can be distorted.





Big Problems Highlighted

Data loss:

old floppy disks

outdated file formats

researchers retiring with data

corrupted files

Ethical issue:


colonial practices in sharing or owning information

also legally some stuff that happens

copyright

museum restrictions

excavation permits


Standardized data formats (CSV, XML, etc.)

Mandatory open access for publicly funded research


Ethical frameworks for sharing data with descendant communities

Collective stewardship rather than researcher-owned data

Implications for History Students (Your angle)

Historians also rely on primary evidence, which needs:

transparency

good documentation

accessible archives

If archaeology becomes fully open:

pressure will grow for history to do the same

history education may shift toward evidence handling, not just reading interpretations

more accountability for claims



Future historians may need to have:

tech literacy

digital archival skills
