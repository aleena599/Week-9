“Like many women studying archaeology, the authors suffered negative experiences, such as gender-based discrimination and harassment in the field, which influenced their choice of career paths and led to their commitment to promoting more equitable workplaces.” 


The quote was a quote that stuck out to me especially throughout the week as I was dealing with the topics, because it made me think that in every dataset such as texts, articles, field notes, there are real people whose experiences are the main reason for what gets recorded, what is common and what becomes part of the knowledge. When I retraced my steps through the log I maintained the previous week, I came to the conclusion that most of the “messiness” which I encountered while getting the texts ready for topic modelling was not only technical, it was also structural. Missing metadata, unclear authorship, inconsistent formatting, all these are signs of the bigger problem this quote mentions, which is about whose voices are allowed to prevail, whose work is supported, and whose stories are properly documented.


The discrimination and unequal support systems in the field of archaeology made me rethink my difficulties. In my log, I pointed out that certain documents resulted in vague or unhelpful topics due to lack of information. After this week's readings, I began to consider how structural barriers, such as gender-based exclusion, lack of mentorship, or unsafe working conditions impact not only the people’s experiences but also the quality and accessibility of the knowledge produced. If those who are discriminated against are either pushed out or not supported, then the discipline loses data, viewpoints, and documentation literally. That has a direct impact on what later researchers (like me, even in a small assignment) can analyze.


And regarding the topic modeling work, I visualize the same trend, we are being instructed to record our procedure, “clean” data and think critically about the meaning of the results. These habits are very in line with the transformation that i see in the readings and in the world of digital archeology.
Interms of our course materials, I think they are putting us through a process of reinforcing the good habits that can solve some of the disciplinary problems, mainly by means of making logs, creating annotations, and taking part in this reflexive assignment. The only suggestion that I could possibly make is to provide more clear instructions on how to document data and workflow, since that enhances our research.



Overall, this week made me aware that better data and better archaeology depends on better conditions for the people who produce it.
